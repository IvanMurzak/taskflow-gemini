# Parallel execution on Antigravity

Antigravity provides concurrent agents but no per-agent cwd. The scheduler must create
one git worktree per task before spawning workers. The root repository is a valid
task repository; `repo: "."` means create the worktree from that repository.

## Capacity and dispatch

Select at most `min(--parallel, available worker slots, ready conflict groups)`.
Issue every `spawn_agent` call before the first wait. Use
`fork_turns: "none"`; each message is only the absolute task-file path. A worker
finds its slot by `worktree-<task-id>` in the repository named by the spec.

## Native isolation

Resolve the task repository and base without reading the task body. Create a
branch/worktree named `worktree-<task-id>` in a writable sibling/temp worktree
root. Verify its toplevel differs from the shared checkout before dispatch.
Never reuse one worktree for two tasks. Native mode needs no Pipeline CLI.

On resume, reconcile the board against `git worktree list --porcelain`, branch,
PR, and CI state. Remove a worktree only after its worker has ended and its work
is committed or merged. Never delete unknown, dirty, locked, or unmerged slots.

## Toolkit isolation

Use toolkit when installed and compatible, or when ports/submodule automation is
needed. Run from the project root and require `status: created`; a reused slot
must be reconciled before dispatch.

```text
pipeline worktree create --name <task-id> --base <base> --submodules <paths> --ports <n> --json
pipeline worktree finalize --name <task-id> --base <base> --submodules <paths> --json
pipeline worktree destroy --name <task-id> --outcome completed --json
pipeline worktree list --json
pipeline ci-wait --pr <n> --repo <owner/repo> --timeout <seconds> --json
pipeline submodule bump --no-admin
pipeline gc --project <root> --clean --json
```

The worktree root must be writable by the Antigravity session. If toolkit fails,
`auto` may use native git worktrees; never fall back to the shared checkout.

## Merge

`on-green` merges only when DoD, required review, and required CI are green.
`ask` and `never` leave the row `🟣`. Workers and reviewers never merge. Never
bypass protection or delete branches/worktrees whose ownership is uncertain.
