![Taskflow — plan, review, tasks, execute](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IvanMurzak/taskflow-gemini/main/docs/taskflow-gemini.svg)

**Tell it what you want in plain words. Get shipped pull requests.**

Taskflow reads your actual repository, writes the plan, argues with the plan,
breaks it into small tasks, and then runs those tasks — each in its own working
directory, each reviewed, each opening its own PR.

Four commands, in order. That is the whole thing.

## Install

```bash
agy plugin marketplace add IvanMurzak/pipeline-gemini-marketplace
agy plugin add taskflow@pipeline
```

Restart Antigravity and the four skills are there.

> One marketplace carries both of my Antigravity plugins, and its id is `pipeline` —
> hence the `@pipeline` suffix. The plugin you just installed is `taskflow`;
> `pipeline` is the other one.

### Optional execution toolkit

```bash
bun add -g @baizor/pipeline    # optional ports/submodule/cleanup automation
```

Antigravity gives a subagent no working directory of its own. Taskflow therefore
creates one native git worktree per task. The CLI is optional automation, not a
requirement for parallel execution.

<details>
<summary><b>Optional — the Pipeline plugin, which is a different thing</b></summary>

<br>

```bash
agy plugin add pipeline@pipeline
```

The plugin adds pipeline authoring — which is what
`--engine=pipeline --pipeline=<name>` then hands each task to. It is separate
from the CLI above and does not substitute for it: the CLI is what provisions a
worker's slot, and Taskflow resolves `pipeline` from `PATH`.

## How to use

![Four stages: plan, review, tasks, execute](docs/taskflow-steps.svg)

Pick a short name for your change. Every step uses that same name.

### 1. Plan it

Tell it the story the way you'd tell a colleague:

```text
/taskflow-plan device-pairing

People with two laptops sign in separately on each one and can't see which
machines are already signed in. I want pairing: approve a new device from
one you're already on, list the devices you have, and revoke any of them.
Revoking should end that device's session and nothing else.
```

It goes and reads your code —
every claim it writes down gets a `file:line` next to it — asks you the two or
three questions that actually change the outcome, and writes the plan to
`.taskflow/YYYY-MM-DD-device-pairing/`.

### 2. Review the plan

```text
/taskflow-review device-pairing
```

Three independent reviewers try to prove the plan wrong: against your code,
against the real specs and vendor docs, and against itself. Confirmed mistakes
get fixed on the spot. Anything that is your call comes back to you as a
question.

### 3. Turn it into tasks

```text
/taskflow-tasks device-pairing
```

The plan becomes numbered, immutable task specs — grouped so that two tasks in
the same wave can never touch the same files — plus a status board in
`ROADMAP.md`.

### 4. Execute

```text
/taskflow-execute device-pairing
```

> Best run in a **fresh context window**. It is a long job, and it does not need
> anything from the conversation you just had — everything it needs is on disk.

It works through the board: verified against the repository rather than against
what a worker claims, one PR per task, board updated after each one. By default,
a PR merges only after DoD, review, CI, and owner gates are green.

Want it faster, and reviewed as it goes? Native git worktrees isolate each
concurrent worker; the Pipeline CLI is optional:

```text
/taskflow-execute device-pairing --parallel=4 --review=high
```

## What lands on disk

```text
.taskflow/2026-08-10-device-pairing/
├── README.md                    the problem, and every decision you locked
├── ROADMAP.md                   the live status board — the only file that changes
├── 01-current-architecture.md   what your code does today, with file:line proof
├── 02-target-architecture.md    what it should do, and the D1..Dn decisions
├── 06-migration-rollout.md      phases, gates, rollback
├── 07-security.md               credentials, threats, controls
└── tasks/
    ├── a1-auth-token-store.md   immutable specs — written once, never edited
    └── b1-pairing-plane.md
```

`ROADMAP.md` is the only mutable record. Task specs never carry status, so a
half-finished run can never lie to you about where it got to.

## The four skills

| Skill | What it does | Writes |
|---|---|---|
| `taskflow-plan` | Explores every affected repository, asks the owner the decisions that change the outcome, and writes a self-contained architecture set. Every factual claim about existing code carries a `file:line` found in that session. | `.taskflow/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/` |
| `taskflow-review` | Runs three independent adversarial reviews — repository truth, external conformance, internal consistency — then applies the confirmed non-product corrections in one batch. Product questions come back to you. | corrections in place |
| `taskflow-tasks` | Decomposes the reviewed plan into immutable, PR-sized task specs with dependencies, conflict-safe groups, model routing tiers, and ROADMAP waves. | `<slug>/tasks/` + the board |
| `taskflow-execute` | Schedules. Computes what is ready, dispatches inside dependency and conflict limits, verifies against the repository rather than a worker's report, and is the sole writer of the board. | PRs + `ROADMAP.md` |

Any user or agent may invoke any stage. No skill pins a model.

### `taskflow-plan`

Give it the story and a short slug. It resolves `.taskflow/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/`,
reports the path, asks 2–4 owner questions that materially change the result, and
writes the document set — current architecture, target architecture, actor flows,
subsystem rules, infrastructure, migration, security, and user workflows — plus
the `ROADMAP.md` skeleton.

Two rules it will not bend: every statement about existing code needs evidence
found in that session, and product policy (deployment target, compatibility,
identity, UX, monetization, scope, anything irreversible) is yours to decide,
recorded as `D1..Dn`.

### `taskflow-review`

Reviewers try to **disprove** the plan, and a finding is only applied after it
has been verified against evidence — a plausible but false correction is worse
than no correction. Mechanical fixes are applied; anything touching product
policy is surfaced to you instead.

### `taskflow-tasks`

Runs only on a locked, reviewed plan with no open product question. Produces one
immutable file per PR-able task, a group table with the conflict rules, model
routing tiers (`security_critical` and `production_touching` route higher), and
the ROADMAP waves.

### `taskflow-execute`

Reads the board, reconciles every non-pending row against real repository
evidence — branches, commits, merged revisions, PRs, CI state — *before* it
dispatches anything, and only then starts work. It schedules; it does not
implement. Implementation happens in `taskflow-implementer` workers, review in
`taskflow-reviewer`, and a worker never reviews its own diff.

## `taskflow-execute` flags

Every flag is optional and every default is shown below. This table is kept in
lockstep with `skills/taskflow-execute/SKILL.md` §3, which wins if the two ever
disagree.

| Flag | Values | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<slug>` (positional) | a taskflow folder under `.taskflow/` | the only folder there | ambiguity is resolved with you, never guessed |
| `--scope=` | `all` · `wave:N` · `group:B` · comma-separated id list | `all` | free-text scope after the slug is also accepted |
| `--parallel=` | `1` · `N` · `auto` | `1` | `>1` (or `auto`) enables concurrent isolated dispatch |
| `--engine=` | `auto` · `native` · `toolkit` · `pipeline` | `auto` | picks the execution tier |
| `--pipeline=` | a pipeline name | — | only valid together with `--engine=pipeline` |
| `--review=` | `off` · `low` · `medium` · `high` · `xhigh` | `off` | anything but `off` dispatches a reviewer that is never the implementer |
| `--merge=` | `ask` · `on-green` · `never` | `on-green` | applies outside the `pipeline` tier, which merges by its own run definition |
| `--submodules=` | `auto` · `off` | `auto` | `auto` means "run the sync only when `git submodule status` is non-empty" |
| `--solo=` | comma-separated id list | empty | forces single-slot dispatch for a task that needs an exclusive resource |
| `--on-fail=` | `continue` · `stop` | `continue` | `stop` drains the in-flight slots and halts the run |
| `--dry-run` | flag | off | prints the resolved plan — flags, ready set, slots, tier, withheld tasks — and dispatches nothing |

An unrecognized `--flag`, or a value outside a flag's vocabulary, stops the run
rather than silently falling back to a default: a mistyped `--paralel=4` never
quietly means `1`. Every resolved value, including defaults nobody typed, is
printed before dispatch begins.

`--parallel=auto` requests 8. What you actually get is the smallest of that, the
number of ready groups, the fixed ceiling of 8, and **the host's own concurrency
slots minus the one the orchestrator occupies** — 4 slots by default on
`gemini-cli 0.147.0`, so three concurrent workers. Antigravity states that cap to the
orchestrator directly, and the orchestrator reads it rather than computing it
from configuration.

Two things are fixed and not configurable: the review fix-round budget (`K = 2`)
and the concurrency ceiling (`8`). Review gating is fixed by depth as well —
`low` and `medium` are advisory, `high` and `xhigh` block — and no flag changes
which.

`--worktree-root`, `--seed` and `--base` are deliberately not part of this
surface; each is owned elsewhere, and being unrecognized they stop the run.

## Execution tiers

`--engine` picks the substrate that provisions a task's working directory.
Default `auto`.

| Tier | Needs | Provides |
|---|---|---|
| `native` | Git | One scheduler-created worktree per task, including root-repository tasks (`repo: "."`) and submodule tasks |
| `toolkit` | A compatible `pipeline` CLI | CLI-managed worktrees, ports, submodule slots, CI waiting, pointer sync, and cleanup |
| `pipeline` | Explicit `--engine=pipeline --pipeline=<name>` | Each task becomes one `pipeline drive` run, which owns implement → review → PR → CI → merge → sync itself. `--merge` does not apply here |

`--engine=auto` never selects `pipeline`: that tier hands merge authority to a
pipeline definition, which is an owner decision and has to be typed.

### Antigravity has no host-provided worktree isolation

The Claude plugin has a third tier, `native`, which needs no CLI at all because
Claude Code cuts a worktree per worker itself and enforces the main-checkout
boundary. **Antigravity offers neither half**, and that was measured rather than
assumed. On `gemini-cli 0.147.0`, two subagents spawned concurrently reported the
same `pwd`, `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, `--git-dir` and `--git-common-dir` as
the root agent; `git worktree list` was unchanged while both were live; all four
files they wrote landed in one directory; and each agent thread's own session
rollout recorded the root's working directory. Antigravity's shipped prompt states it
outright — *"All agents share the same directory … edits made by one agent are
immediately visible to all other agents."* A `.gemini/agents/*.toml` role changes
the persona, not the filesystem.

The full experiment, its caveats, and instructions for re-running it against a
newer Antigravity build are in
[`docs/2026-08-09-gemini-subagent-isolation.md`](docs/2026-08-09-gemini-subagent-isolation.md).

Taskflow's `native` tier supplies the missing mechanism itself with git
worktrees. The measurement still matters: merely spawning agents is not
isolation.

**The consequence is the inverse of the Claude plugin's.**

- **The Pipeline CLI is optional.** It adds ports and lifecycle automation over
  native git worktrees.
- **`--parallel > 1` always requires worktrees, not necessarily the CLI.** Two
  agents in the shared checkout would collide; native mode prevents that.
- **Dispatch and isolation are separate concerns on this host.** Antigravity subagents
  are the correct dispatch primitive and remain so; what they do not supply is a
  working directory. Do not read the presence of subagents as evidence of
  isolation.

### "Antigravity is less isolated" is the wrong summary

Antigravity is not a weaker sandbox than Claude Code. It is a differently shaped one,
and at the **session edge it is tighter**: writes outside the session workspace
were refused on *both* the shell path and the `apply_patch` path, where Claude
Code's guard is git-aware rather than filesystem-aware and lets an ordinary shell
redirect through. What Antigravity lacks is a boundary **between workers** — and that
is the only boundary the `native` tier is defined by.

| | Claude Code | Antigravity 0.147.0 |
|---|---|---|
| Worktree per worker | Yes, host-created | **No** — one shared tree |
| Tool-path write outside the boundary | Blocked | Blocked |
| Shell-path write outside the boundary | **Not blocked** | Blocked |
| Boundary between two workers | Yes | **None** |

The two hosts fail in opposite directions and neither is strictly safer. That
asymmetry is why this plugin creates native worktrees explicitly on Antigravity.

### Why the minimum is 0.17.0

`--engine=auto` reads `pipeline --version` and compares it **numerically**
against `0.17.0` — never by checking that the binary exists, and never by probing
the subcommand. At or above it, `auto` resolves to `toolkit`. Below it, absent,
or unparseable, the run states the reason once and continues in native mode. A CLI
that is present but older resolves the same way, because a presence check would
resolve it to `toolkit` and then fail on first use — a silent misdetection
instead of an announced degradation.

**0.17.0 is the first published release whose `pipeline worktree list --json`
reports a hook-provisioned slot's `submodule_slots[].dir`.** That property is
what this plugin depends on, and it is *not* the same as "the first release
shipping `pipeline worktree`" — that derivation yields 0.16.0, and 0.16.0 is
unsafe. On released 0.16.0 the array is empty for every hook-provisioned slot, so
a resumed run enumerates the repositories a slot spans from an empty list and
concludes that a submodule slot holding uncommitted work is an empty shell. That
verdict destroyed 21,880 bytes of finished implementation in this design's own
proving run.

### What native mode does not automate

Native git worktrees provide repository and branch isolation, including for the
root repository and submodules. They do not allocate collision-free ports or
provide the toolkit's lifecycle records. A task requiring those facilities stays
pending until toolkit execution is available.

## Why `--merge` defaults to `on-green`

`on-green` merges only after DoD verification, required review, required CI,
and owner gates pass. It never bypasses branch protection. Use `ask` to hold for
manual approval or `never` to leave verified PRs open. The `pipeline` tier owns
its own merge policy.

## Workflow contract

- Artifacts live only in `.taskflow/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/`. Prefix every new folder
  with its local creation date; do not rename existing folders.
- `ROADMAP.md` is the sole mutable task-state record. Task specs are immutable
  and never contain `status`.
- Task groups run sequentially by `sequence`; independent groups may run in
  parallel when their `needs` dependencies allow it, `--parallel` is raised above
  its default, and an execution tier is available to place the workers.
- `security_critical` and `production_touching` raise the model-routing tier —
  a different thing from the execution tier above, and the two never interact.
- Production, money, secrets, irreversible effects, and product decisions require
  an explicit owner gate.
